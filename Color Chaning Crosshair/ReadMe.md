Color Changing Crosshair scripts for [Team Fortress 2](https://www.teamfortress.com).
## Installation
Choose if you want color changing script for default movement or [nullcanceling](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting#Null-Cancelling_Movement_Scripts). Go to the appropriate file (default or null) and copy the context within it. Now go to your tf2 local files and go to **cfg**. Find and open your [autoexec](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2302798837). In here, paste the script you choosed. Launch the game and check out your new colors! If you don't have a autoexec, I've added a template just in case you need it.
