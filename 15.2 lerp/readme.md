# Please read!
I know this looks different from the video, but just read the install instruction down bellow, and it should be just as easy :) <br>
Should there be any problem, you can always ask for help over at my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RfgA6wqzZP).
15.2 lerp script for [Team Fortress 2](https://www.teamfortress.com).
## Installation
If you have a autoexec from before, simply copy the context from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/main/15.2%20lerp/autoexec.cfg) website and paste it into your autoexec. If not, just download [this](https://github.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/releases/download/v1.0/autoexec.cfg) and put it in `tf\cfg`.
## Installation (Mastercomfig)
**Note**: Mastercomfig has optimized net values for hitscan and projectile classes, but if you still want 15.2 lerp on every class, continue with the installation instructions bellow. <br> If you're using masterconfig, your autoexec is located in `tf\cfg\overrides`. Mastercomfig also uses custom net settings which you need to override to get 15.2 lerp on all the classes. This is done with the `modules.cfg` file. You can get it [here](https://github.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/releases/download/v1.0/modules.cfg). If you already have a `modules.cfg`, please copy the context from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/main/15.2%20lerp/modules.cfg) website into it. <br>
Now simply drop your `modules.cfg` into `tf\cfg\overrides`. If you don't have a overrides folder, just create one. :) <br>
That's it. Enjoy!
