# Please read!
I know this looks different from the video, but just read the install instruction down bellow, and it should be just as easy :) <br>
Should there be any problem, you can always ask for help over at my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RfgA6wqzZP).
## Installation
If you have a autoexec from before, simply copy the context from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/main/15.2%20lerp/autoexec.cfg) website and paste it into your autoexec. If not, just download [this](https://github.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/releases/download/v1.0/autoexec.cfg) and put it in `Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg`.
## Installation (Mastercomfig)
**Note**: Mastercomfig has optimized net values for hitscan (30.3 lerp) and projectile classes (15.2 lerp), but if you would like to override them, you can still do so! A good example is if you'd like to play demonight. Demonight is a melee based subclass and thus hitscan would be better to use, but mastercomfig defaults to 15.2 cause it's a projectile based class by default. So, how do we fix this issue? Well, by the use of mastercomfig's override system.
### 15.2 lerp for all classes
Mastercomfig - when downloaded with customizations - comes with a overrides folder which will be placed in `Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg`. If you don't have one, you can download [this](https://github.com/mastercomfig/mastercomfig/releases/latest/download/template.zip) template and place it there manually. Once everything is in place, you'll have a `modules.cfg` file in there. [Download](https://github.com/WhyiMicro/TF2-Mods/releases/download/v1.0/modules.cfg) or replace the content of [this](https://github.com/WhyiMicro/TF2-Mods/blob/main/15.2%20lerp/modules.cfg) file there and you should be set!
### 15.2 lerp for specific classes
If you rather use a specific lerp value for each class, you can use the [class configs](https://docs.mastercomfig.com/latest/faq/?h=class#why-does-mastercomfig-override-my-class-configs) in `Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg\overrides`. These class configs are used to customize each class. As an example, we can customize the lerp for demoman. So, since we wanna change demoman's lerp, we're gonna located and open `demoman.cfg`. In here, we're gonna put `net_hitscan` (30.3 lerp) on an empty line. Once that's done, you should be finished! Just make sure to save the file. <br>
