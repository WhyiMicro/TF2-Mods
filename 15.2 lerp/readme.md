I know this looks different from the video, but just read the install instruction down bellow, and it should be just as easy :) <br>
Should there be any problem, you can always ask for help over at my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RfgA6wqzZP).
15.2 lerp script for [Team Fortress 2](https://www.teamfortress.com).
## Installation
If you have a autoexec from before, simply copy the context from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/main/15.2%20lerp/autoexec.cfg) website and paste it into your autoexec. If not, just download [this](https://github.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/releases/download/v1.0/autoexec.cfg) and put it in `tf\cfg`. <br>
**Note:** If you're using masterconfig, your autoexec is likely located in `tf\cfg\overrides`, so please take that into consideration!
