Void skybox for the game [Team Fortress 2](https://www.teamfortress.com). It's a plain, pitch black skybox which should replace all the default ones. It won't work on sv pure servers, but is still fun to use whenever it's allowed. As far as I can tell, it does **not** boost fps in any way.
## Installation
Go grab the `.vpk` file for the skybox [here](https://github.com/tf2iMicro/TF2-Mods/releases/download/v1.0/void_skybox.vpk). Once downloaded, locate your `tf\custom` folder and put the `.vpk` file in it. That should be all. Launch the game and enjoy your new skybox!
